## Overview:
* The purpose of the **W.O.D. App** is to help a user find a workout they can do that day. The home page displays a random Workout Of the Day, (W.O.D.), that details the workout description, its timecap and any weight the user may need.
* If the randomly generated workout does not appeal, (its too long, or requires equipment the user doesn't have, or they have done it recently in the past for example), the user can click the 'Workouts' button to see a list of other workouts they can choose form instead.
* Additionally, the user can 'Favorite' a workout by clicking on the star on that workout card. That workout then goes into a separate list of 'Favorite Workouts'. NOTE: It is still displayed in the list of all workouts, but the star becomes solid black instead of just having an outline.
* If the user no longer wants that workout in their favorites page, clicking the star will remove it from the favorites page and the star turns from solid black back to just an outline.
